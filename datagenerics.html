<h3>Data.Generics (aka SYB)</h3>
<div>
The documentation of Data.Generics, aka syb or scrap your boilerplate,
is extremely ... shall we say ... terse.  So when I figure something
out I like to make a note about it here so I can refer back.

Anything you want to use the Data.Generics library on must be an instance
of <code>Data</code> (<code>Typeable</code>?).  So what can you do?

<h4>Making Queries</h4>

The <code>mkQ</code> function turns a normal function of type <code>a</code>
into a function suitable for use where a GenericQ is expected.  For example,
<pre>
% ghci
λ :set -XDeriveDataTypeable
λ :m +Data.Generics
λ data T = T Int Char Double deriving (Data, Show)
λ mkQ "?" (show :: T -> String) (T 1 'c' 3.5)
"T 1 'c' 3.5"
</pre>
(It is important to understand how we are applying a signature to the
function <code>show</code> to restrict it to operate only on
type <code>T</code>.  Without this the type of <code>show</code>
is <code>show :: Show a => a -> String</code>, which will not be
recognized by the syb mechansims as matching <code>T</code>.)

The function <code>gmapQ</code> operates on the "immediate subterms"
of the value, hence
<pre>
λ gmapQ (mkQ "?" (show :: Int -> String)) (T 1 'c' 3.5)
["1","?","?"]
</pre>
We can use <code>extQ</code> to "extend" our query function to operate
on more than one type:
<pre>
λ gmapQ (mkQ "?" (show :: Int -> String) `extQ` (show :: Char -> String)) (T 1 'c' 3.5)
["1","'c'","?"]
</pre>
We use <code>mkQ</code> to create queries - functions that find values
of a set of particular types and converts each to a single type.
Similarly, we can use <code>mkT</code> to create transformations,
which convert values of the generic types to different values of the
generic type:
<pre>
λ everywhere (mkT ((+ 1) :: Int -> Int)) (T 1 'c' 3.5)
(T 2 'c' 3.5)
λ everywhere (mkT ((+ 1) :: Int -> Int) `extT` (const 'z' :: Char -> Char)) (T 1 'c' 3.5)
(T 2 'z' 3.5)
</pre>

<h4>And now...</h4>

I have a large data structure for which I currently use template
haskell to generate the function <code>peekRow :: s -> [Peek
s]</code>.  The elements of this list normally correspond to the
fields of whatever the data structure <code>s</code> represents, but
there is a list of exceptions to this rule for types <code>Either,
Maybe, (a, b), [a], Map</code>, and a type similar to <code>Map</code>
named <code>Order</code>.  What does this look like if I switch from
template haskell to syb?  Here is an example of the code generated for
a structure named <code>ImageSize</code> with three fields:
<pre>
peekRow (Proxy) (_s@(ImageSize {})) =
    mconcat [concatMap (\pth -> case pth of
                                  p@(Path_ImageSize_dim _wp) -> map (\a -> peekCons p (Just a)) (toListOf (toLens p) _s :: [Dimension])
                                  _ -> [])
                       (paths (Proxy :: Proxy Univ) _s (Proxy :: Proxy Dimension)),
             concatMap (\pth -> case pth of
                                  p@(Path_ImageSize_size _wp) -> map (\a -> peekCons p (Just a)) (toListOf (toLens p) _s :: [Double])
                                  _ -> [])
                       (paths (Proxy :: Proxy Univ) _s (Proxy :: Proxy Double)),
             concatMap (\pth -> case pth of
                                  p@(Path_ImageSize_units _wp) -> map (\a -> peekCons p (Just a)) (toListOf (toLens p) _s :: [Units])
                                  _ -> [])
                       (paths (Proxy :: Proxy Univ) _s (Proxy :: Proxy Units))] :: [Peek Univ ImageSize]
</pre>
The <code>paths</code> function returns a list; this needs to be
changed to a fold.
